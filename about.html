    <h1>Get to know Me</h1>

      <div class="card"><img src="./assets/mee1.jpg" alt="me 1">
      <p><br> I grew up in the Philippines and moved to Canada in early 2016. As a young kid, I knew I always have a passion for creativity, the arts and design.
        Over the years, I have developed my skills in in traditional or digital drawing, painting and photography. Unfortunately, I eventualy lost my passion and interest. 
        This lead me explore what life had to show after I graduated high school.
        <br><br>
        I was torn between pursuing Nursing school or Art school at AuArts. I had a strong interest in both fields, but I was highly unsure which path to take.
        Instead of going to Nursing or Art school, I decided to take a gap year to explore my options and figure out what I truly wanted to do.
        I eventually decided to go out on a limb and study Business at SAIT, majoring in Marketing. <br><br> 
         Now, with a diploma in Marketing, life leaves me questioniong my choices while I quantify the value of 
         my future, the arts, money, and the reality of circumstances. But, life in the 20s is indeed a journey of self-discovery and exploration. You makes mistakes, you learn, you grow, and you find your way and soon everything will fall into place.
        <br><br>
        While my passion for creativity, have not permanently left me, I wanted to further explore other paths that incorporate both my marketing background with similar creative relations.
        This currently leads me to go back to school again at SAIT as double major in web development and UX design with a bit of graphic design!
